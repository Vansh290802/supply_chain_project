# Inventory Management Module

## Overview
This module implements inventory optimization and management strategies for the supply chain network.

## Key Results

### Optimization Metrics
From analysis logs:
- Safety Stock: 55,552.30 units
- Reorder Point: 87,032.33 units
- Economic Order Quantity: 46,883.16 units

## Implementation Details

### 1. Inventory Analysis
Components analyzed:
- Warehouse inventory levels
- Historical demand patterns
- Lead time variations
- Order fulfillment rates

### 2. Optimization Calculations
#### Safety Stock
- Based on lead time and demand variability
- 95% service level implemented
- Considers demand and lead time standard deviations

#### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
Calculated using:
- Annual demand
- Ordering cost
- Holding cost (20% of item cost)

### 3. Demand Prediction
- Implementation: RandomForestRegressor
- Features: Historical demand, inventory levels, supplier reliability
- Purpose: Future demand forecasting

## Key Components

### 1. Inventory Level Analysis
Metrics tracked:
- Average inventory levels
- Minimum inventory levels
- Maximum inventory levels
- Stockout frequency
- Inventory turnover

### 2. Warehouse Efficiency
Factors considered:
- Loading/unloading time
- Equipment availability
- Order fulfillment rate
- Inventory accuracy

## Recommendations
Current system suggests:
- Improve handling equipment availability
- Monitor inventory turnover rates
- Optimize reorder points

## Usage
```python
from inventory_management import InventoryManager

# Initialize manager
inventory_manager = InventoryManager()

# Analyze inventory levels
inventory_stats = inventory_manager.analyze_inventory_levels(df)

# Get optimization results
optimization = inventory_manager.optimize_inventory(df)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = inventory_manager.generate_inventory_recommendations(df)
```
